## Cyber Traffic Data üö¶

This project was created for the [BorderHacks 2021 Traffic Data Challenge](https://devpost.com/software/cyber-traffic-data).

## Inspiration üí°

Our goal is to help local Windsorites understand their traffic patterns better, aiming to make the city safer. We leveraged the City of Windsor‚Äôs OpenData API to provide valuable traffic insights.

## Features üëÄ

- **API Access**: Users can access Windsor‚Äôs OpenData API and view traffic data based on their input.
- **Visualization**: Traffic data is visualized using Google Maps, providing an intuitive and interactive experience.

## How We Built It üõ†Ô∏è

- **Frontend**: Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporating the Google Maps API for visualization.
- **Backend**: Machine learning models were built using Python to analyze and predict traffic patterns.

## Machine Learning Details ü§ñ

### Data Collection and Preparation
We fetched traffic data for the years 2020 and 2021 from the City of Windsor‚Äôs OpenData API. The data was then cleaned and transformed for analysis:
```python
# Fetching traffic data from the API
start_date = date(2020, 1, 1)
end_date = date(2020, 12, 31)
date_diff = end_date - start_date
for i in range(date_diff.days + 1):
    dates = start_date + td(days=i)
    url = f"https://opendata.citywindsor.ca/api/traffic?date={dates}&intersectionId=1&start_time=00%3A00&end_time=23%3A59"
    if i == 0:
        df = requests.get(url=url, verify=False)
data_2020 = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(df.json(), orient='columns')

# Converting JSON data to DataFrame
df1 = pd.DataFrame(data_2020['traffic'].values.tolist())
data_2020 = pd.concat([data_2020, df1], axis=1)
```

### Feature Engineering
We added new time-related columns to the DataFrame to capture more information:
```python
vehicle['timeStamp'] = pd.to_datetime(vehicle['timeStamp'])
vehicle['day_of_week'] = vehicle['timeStamp'].dt.dayofweek
vehicle['day'] = vehicle['timeStamp'].dt.day
vehicle['day_of_year'] = vehicle['timeStamp'].dt.dayofyear
vehicle['year'] = vehicle['timeStamp'].dt.year
vehicle['month'] = vehicle['timeStamp'].dt.month
vehicle['hours'] = vehicle['timeStamp'].dt.hour
```

### Model Training
We used the XGBoost regression model to predict traffic patterns:
```python
# Splitting the data into training and testing sets
X = hour_count.drop(['Vehicles'], axis=1)
y = hour_count.Vehicles
xtrain, xtest, ytrain, ytest = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, shuffle=True)

# Training the XGBoost model
xgbr = xgb.XGBRegressor(verbosity=0)
xgbr.fit(xtrain, ytrain)
```

### Model Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy scores and visualizations:
```python
# Calculating training and testing accuracy
train_score = xgbr.score(xtrain, ytrain)
test_score = xgbr.score(xtest, ytest)
print(f"Training score: {train_score}")
print(f"Testing score: {test_score}")

# Making predictions and plotting results
ypred = xgbr.predict(xtest)
plt.subplots(figsize=(21, 6))
plt.plot(range(len(ytest)), ytest, label="original")
plt.plot(range(len(ytest)), ypred, label="predicted")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Cross-Validation and Unseen Data
We performed cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and evaluated it on unseen data:
```python
# Cross-validation
scores_xg = cross_val_score(xgbr, X, y, cv=5)
print(f"Cross-validation scores: {scores_xg}")
print(f"Mean accuracy: {scores_xg.mean()}")

# Evaluating on unseen data
score_unseen = xgbr.score(X_unseen, y_unseen)
print(f"Accuracy on unseen data: {score_unseen}")
```
